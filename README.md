# Extension2ContentTypeMapper
Get mime type (content type) by file extension. 

Refresh your extension to content type map locally by using: `Extension2ContentTypeMapper::refreshSource()` and `Extension2ContentTypeMapper::generateJson()`

Just copy the php file and use it.

Don't forget to change the namespace and file paths.
